    <h2><strong><em>My Story</em></strong> </h2>
    <p>
        I have two most important things in my life. They mean a lot to me. One is my beautiful wife Selome and the other is my family. Having those two makes my life more beautiful and interesting. After got accepted to this program I immediately went back home and married my sweat heart, my lifelong friend Selome. It has been exactly one month. That was the best and special moment in my life.
        <p>
        After I stayed here united states about five months, I decided to continue my study. I have bachelor’s degree in computer science from Wachemo university. After I graduated, I begin to love software developer.  I have developed some personal websites, modern resume for myself and for my friends, that can be accessed by domain name and mobile apps.
        </p> that gave me confidence that I can be a software developer.  I then started to do some research on universities that offer master’s in software development. I also have asked some Ethiopian friends who earned master’s degree in software development. They have referred me to this university. Up on their referral I have contacted the program manager at computer science department and explained me in detail about the courses they offer.  I liked it. I told myself this is the university that will fulfill my dream. I immediately started the process of application to get admitted and here I am.
        If am going to talk about my future carrier, I would love to work for very well-known and big companies like apple, google, Microsoft...etc. I would love to work for limited of time until I get good experience, because my long-term dream is to work for myself. I would love to open my own software company.
